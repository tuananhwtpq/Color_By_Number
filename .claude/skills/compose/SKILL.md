# Compose Expert Skill

Non-opinionated, practical guidance for writing correct, performant Compose code —
across Android, Desktop, iOS, and Web. Covers Jetpack Compose and Compose Multiplatform.
Backed by analysis of actual source code from `androidx/androidx` and
`JetBrains/compose-multiplatform-core`.

## Workflow

When helping with Compose code, follow this checklist:

### 1. Understand the request
- What Compose layer is involved? (Runtime, UI, Foundation, Material3, Navigation)
- Is this a state problem, layout problem, performance problem, or architecture question?
- Is this Android-only or Compose Multiplatform (CMP)?

### 2. Analyze the design (if visual reference provided)
- If the user shares a Figma frame, screenshot, or design spec, consult `references/design-to-compose.md`
- Decompose the design into a composable tree
- Transcribe, don't adapt — copy, casing, punctuation and number format come across exactly; resolve each value to the token that matches it exactly, and add a token the theme lacks rather than substituting the nearest (`references/design-to-compose.md`)
- Map design tokens to MaterialTheme, spacing to CompositionLocals
- Identify animation needs — `references/animation.md` (contentKey, phase rule, M3 motion tokens), `references/animation-recipes.md` (shimmer/loading-crossfade + choreography), or `references/animation-advanced.md` (shared-element, predictive back, `drawBehind`-for-color)

### 3. Consult the right reference
Read the relevant reference file(s) from `references/` before answering:

| Topic | Reference File |
|-------|---------------|
| State-hoisting boundary (UI-value-drives-business-logic), `derivedStateOf`-capture trap, cross-phase back-writing, durable-state-over-events, `@ReadOnlyComposable` | `references/state-management.md` |
| Slot / content-API authoring — receiver scopes (`RowScope`), optional (nullable) slots, `XxxDefaults`, slot-vs-boolean-flag | `references/view-composition.md` |
| Screen/content split (private content composable), framework-state-stays-in-UI (not hoisted to the ViewModel) | `references/screen-structure.md` |
| Modifier-as-API-contract rules (no hardcoded placement on a reusable root, caller-modifier-first) + chain ordering | `references/modifiers.md` |
| Effects (`LaunchedEffect`/`DisposableEffect`/`SideEffect`), lifecycle effects (`LifecycleResumeEffect`), effect anti-patterns | `references/side-effects.md` |
| `compositionLocalOf` vs `staticCompositionLocalOf` (recomposition scope), custom locals, no-mutable-State-in-a-local | `references/composition-locals.md` |
| LazyList perf traps — `indexOf()`-O(n²), no-new-objects-in-key, `animateItem`, `ReportDrawnWhen`, infinite-scroll trigger | `references/lists-scrolling.md` |
| Navigation 3 (`NavDisplay`, back-stack-as-state, compose-shape guardrails); type-safe `@Serializable` routes | `references/navigation.md` |
| `AnimatedContent` contentKey-on-shape, defer-reads-to-latest-phase (lambda modifiers), M3 motion/easing tokens | `references/animation.md` |
| Animation recipes (shimmer/loading-crossfade), sequential/parallel/staggered choreography | `references/animation-recipes.md` |
| Shared-element transitions (`sharedBounds`/`sharedElement`/`skipToLookaheadSize`), `drawBehind`-for-animated-color, predictive back | `references/animation-advanced.md` |
| Extending the theme beyond M3's three slots — custom design tokens via `CompositionLocal` | `references/theming-material3.md` |
| Touch targets, spacing, canonical layouts, foldables, M3 compliance audit | `android-skills:android-ux` |
| Recomposition skipping, stability, baseline profiles, benchmarking | `references/performance.md` |
| Traversal order (`traversalIndex` / `isTraversalGroup`), live-region mode (`Polite` vs `Assertive`) | `references/accessibility.md` |
| `FocusRequester`, `focusable()`, `focusProperties`, key events, D-pad, TV, keyboard, focus restoration | `references/focus-navigation.md` |
| Removed/replaced APIs, migration paths from older Compose versions | `references/deprecated-patterns.md` |
| **Styles API** (experimental): `Style {}`, `MutableStyleState`, `Modifier.styleable()` | `references/styles-experimental.md` |
| Transcribing a design — exact copy/casing/number format, exact-token-vs-near-neighbour, missing-token-added-not-substituted, export-over-render as source of truth; Figma `dropShadow`/`innerShadow` (1.9+, chain placement), spacing/elevation design-token CompositionLocal | `references/design-to-compose.md` |
| Production crash patterns, defensive coding, state/performance rules | `references/production-crash-playbook.md` |
| CMP gotchas (`collectAsState`-in-commonMain, commonMain `@Preview` package, Lottie→Kottie, compiler-stability-non-JVM) + Android-only→CMP migration | `references/multiplatform.md` |
| Desktop (Window, Tray, MenuBar), iOS (UIKitView), Web (ComposeViewport) | `references/platform-specifics.md` |

### 4. Apply and verify
- Write code that follows the patterns in the reference
- Flag any anti-patterns you see in the user's existing code
- Suggest the minimal correct solution — don't over-engineer

### 5. Cite the source
When referencing Compose internals, point to the exact source file:
```
// See: compose/runtime/runtime/src/commonMain/kotlin/androidx/compose/runtime/Composer.kt
```

## Key Principles

1. **Compose thinks in three phases**: Composition → Layout → Drawing. State reads in each
   phase only trigger work for that phase and later ones.

2. **Recomposition is frequent and cheap** — but only if you help the compiler skip unchanged
   scopes. Use stable types, avoid allocations in composable bodies.

3. **Modifier order matters**. `Modifier.padding(16.dp).background(Color.Red)` is visually
   different from `Modifier.background(Color.Red).padding(16.dp)`.

4. **State should live as low as possible** and be hoisted only as high as needed. Don't put
   everything in a ViewModel just because you can.

5. **Side effects exist to bridge Compose's declarative world with imperative APIs**. Use the
   right one for the job — misusing them causes bugs that are hard to trace.

6. **Compose Multiplatform shares the runtime but not the platform**. UI code in
   `commonMain` is portable. Platform-specific APIs (`LocalContext`, `BackHandler`,
   `Window`) require `expect`/`actual` or conditional source sets.

## Source Code Verification

Always verify against **live source code** — never rely on training data alone.

### Tier 1 (Preferred): `android-sources` MCP server

When available, use the MCP tools for fast, precise lookups:

```
lookup_class(className: "LazyListState")
lookup_method(className: "Composer", methodName: "startRestartGroup")
search_in_source(query: "fun rememberLazyListState")
list_class_members(className: "Modifier")
get_class_hierarchy(className: "LazyListState")
find_references(className: "SnapshotState", methodName: "value")
```

### Tier 2 (Fallback): Raw GitHub URLs

If the MCP server is unavailable, fetch source directly:

- **AndroidX**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/androidx/androidx/androidx-main/{path}`
- **Directory listing**: `gh api repos/androidx/androidx/contents/{path}`
- **CMP**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform-core/jb-main/{path}`
- **AOSP platform**: `https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/refs/heads/main/{path}?format=TEXT` (base64)

### Two-layer approach
1. **Start with guidance** — read the topic-specific reference (e.g., `references/state-management.md`)
2. **Verify against live source** — use MCP tools or raw GitHub to confirm behavior

## Authoritative Docs

For guidance, best practices, or migration guides — things source code alone can't answer — prefer Google's Android Knowledge Base over web search:

```bash
android docs search "LazyColumn performance"              # ranked kb:// URLs + summaries
android docs fetch kb://android/develop/ui/compose/lists  # full content of a result
```

4800+ curated docs across Android, Wear, TV, KMP, and Glance. Use this when the internal files in `references/` don't cover your question; use source code lookups (above) when you need implementation details rather than guidance.
